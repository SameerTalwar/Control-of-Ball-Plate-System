# Control-of-Ball-Plate-System
A 2 dof system involving a ball and a plate and two servo/DC motors. Torque input given to the motors rotate the plate in 2 dimensions, enabling control in trajectory of the ball.

Control law applied- LQR and PID to track straight line trajectory, circular trajectory and lissajous curve
